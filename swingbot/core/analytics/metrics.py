"""Pure metrics over closed-trade record lists -- no file I/O, no config
imports. Every function degrades gracefully on missing/malformed keys
(skip + count, never raise) per this plan's Global Constraints.

`closed` throughout this module means "a list of trade dicts, some subset
of which may be closed" -- callers are NOT required to pre-filter to
status in ("win", "loss") before calling; every function here filters
internally by whatever status/field it actually needs, so passing the
full unfiltered trades.json list is always safe (open trades simply
contribute nothing, since they lack exit_price/realized_pnl_amount)."""

    any trade closed" at the starting balance, rather than jumping
    straight to the first trade's post-close balance with no baseline --
    this is what makes an equity chart read as "flat, then it moves" for
    the calm period before the first close, instead of starting the
    chart already mid-move.
